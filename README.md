Lesson on learning how to organize folders and files for a sigle project (Repository) - GitHub_intro

Hey guys,

I'm one of the many students of the Free Lambda School Mini Code Bootcamp.
I am a female who relocated from SA at the end of January, as my husband is a US citizen who was an expat working in SA for a couple of years and had to come back home when his contract ended. I started my journey in the amazing, really cool and fun world of Web Dev last year and i'm loving it. 

I started with an online course on Web Dev, which I thoroughly enjoyed and realized upon completing that course that I enjoy front-end development more. I am now in the USA exploring and working on honing my new found skill with the hopes of becoming a successful freelancer in the near future as I wait on my naturalization process.

This is my attempt at joining GitHub and learning how to use it so that I can submit and share my assignment with my fellow Mini Bootcamp class mates. I hope it works.
